# Release Notes
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 0.39.1 Jul 26, 2023

### New

- q-server 0.63.0

## 0.39.0 Jul 21, 2023

### New

- Aborted transaction VM trace is put into transaction JSON field `trace`

## 0.38.0 Apr 27, 2023

### New

- Added node time mode `seq` – sequential. In this mode node produces single block for
  each transaction. All blocks have `gen_utime` equals to the `gen_utime` of the previous
  block + 1 sec.  
  Use `/se/seq-mode-on` endpoint to turn the mode on.   
  Read more in [SE live control (REST API)](./README.md#se-live-control-rest-api) section
- New forward fee config from Everscale mainnet.

### Improved

- Internal structure was simplified.
- `TonNodeEngine` was isolated from API services.
- Added `MemDocumentsDb` – to use `TonNodeEngine` without ArangoDB but with access to produced 
  parsed artefacts. 
- Added `ShardStorage` based on the single and simple `KVStorage` as a shardstate internal storage 
  instead of four independent storages.
- Added `MemStorage` and `FSStorage` as two main shard storage implementations.
- Added `TonEngine.time` with responsibility for a block time management. 
- `TonNodeEngine` can be used as an in-memory blockchain emulator. It is useful for example 
  for smart contract testing.


## 0.37.1 Mar 21, 2023

### Fixed

- Build docker image with q-server v0.55.0

## 0.37.0 Feb 17, 2023

### New

- `CapSignatureWithId` capability is supported: `global_id` parameter is used as a `signature_id` if `CapSignatureWithId` cap is turned  
    on in the blockchain config.

### Improved

- The [list of givers](./contracts) was refactored.

### Fixed
